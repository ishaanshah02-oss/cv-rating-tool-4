# CV Rating Tool (Repo-Ready)

A lightweight, client-side CV rating tool. Paste text or upload a PDF. No backend required.

## Files (place at repo root)
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

> **Important**: Keep these three files at the **root** of your repository. Do **not** put them inside a subfolder. GitHub Pages is case-sensitive: `script.js` must match exactly.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Push these files to your repo root (e.g., `cv-rating-tool-v2`).
2. Repo **Settings → Pages** → **Source**: `main` branch / `root` → **Save`**.
3. Wait ~1 minute, then visit: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.
4. If changes don't appear, do a **hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R).

## Troubleshooting
- Visit `/script.js` on your live site to confirm the script loads (no 404).
- Open DevTools → Console; you should see `script.js LOADED` on refresh.
- If a PDF doesn't load, ensure the PDF has selectable text (not a scanned image).
